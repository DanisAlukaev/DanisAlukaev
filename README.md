## Hi there 👋

I'm experienced R&D Engineer in Deep Learning with over two years of expertise in computer vision and natural language processing reinforcing corporate brand as innovative.

### 🚀 Projects
- Automatic essay evaluator [Linguask](https://github.com/Vitsyn-Morgunov-and-Nikulin/automatic-essay-evaluator) for assessing natural language text by analytical measures, e.g., vocabulary, syntax, cohesion etc. Special attention is given to quality ensuring techniques that (partially) automate routine operations and restrict programmers from violating style rules and designing non-working code.
- Сlosed-source deep learning package `spiner` used in AI Lab of Innopolis University to explore morphometry of vertebrae and intervertebral discs, measure coronal and sagittal Cobb angles, classify and segment osteoporosis on each vertebra.
- Open-source Django-driven app [Doctorinna](https://github.com/Doctorinna) for determining the user's risk group for various diseases. This project was mentioned by Lab Director in Huawei [Yegor Bugayenko](https://github.com/yegor256) in his [blog post](https://www.yegor256.com/2021/12/01/teaching.html).
- Closed-source `albumentations`-integrable package `purelung` used in AI Lab of Innopolis University for suppressing bone shadows, context-aware image crop, image segmentation, and auto-inverse operation in the Chest X-ray images.  

### 🧬 Research
- Currently working on inherently interpretable machine learning architecture under supervision of [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org) (Prof. in University of Edinburgh, h-index 45).
- European Spine Journal (Q1): <i>"A deep learning framework for vertebral morphometry and Cobb angle measurement with external validation"</i>, available [online](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-022-07245-4), under supervision of [Bulat Ibragimov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IPQZ4bkAAAAJ) (Prof. in University of Copenhagen, h-index 26).
